Heroes of Pymoli Analysis: 


Congratulations! After a lot of hard work in the data munging mines, you've landed a job as Lead Analyst for an independent gaming company. You've been assigned the task of analyzing the data for their most recent fantasy game Heroes of Pymoli.

Like many others in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. As a first task, the company would like you to generate a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights.



Written description of three observable trends based on the data:

1) Purchasing Analysis (Age) Table
Based on the table, players around the age of 20-24 make the most purchases on the game. I would recommend focusing on creating different content to the game to keep appealing to that age group. I would also recomment seeing what the other age groups are wanting from the game to have more in game purchases from the other age groups.


2) Most Popular Item
The most purchased item is the "Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm." With this data, we can hypothesize that this item can be used for multiple areas/characters in the game. It seems like the item is heavily needed if 12 out of the 576 players are purchasing the item. 


3) Purchasing Analysis (Gender)
The game is predominately male players. Since they make up a majority of the player demographic, they are also going to be making more in game purchases compared to the opposite gender. However, the average total per person is similar in both males and females, so there is no significant difference between the average spending price between the two genders.
